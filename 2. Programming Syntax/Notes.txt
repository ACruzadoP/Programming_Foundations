Most popular languages:
    - Java
    - Python - easier to learn
    - JS - easier to learn
    - C++
    - C#


In this course, Python will be the one to be used. 



Installing Python on Mac: Not needed, as it comes by default. Maybe it needs to be updated but that's it. 
-------------------------

    "python" should retrieve the python version that's installed. Also, it should open python in the sense that Terminal will be ready 
    for us to start sending python commands. 
    "exit()" should allow us to exit python 

    *IMPORTANT: After having installed the latest version, 
    we may need to switch to "python3", instead of "python". 
    Or "python4" if the 4th version was the one installed. 

        *Or maybe it's always "python3" to initiate python. 



Feel free to check the following installation guide:
"Exercise Files\Chap02\Troubleshooting Installation Issues.docx"



If we want to use python from VS Code, we need to install its Extension and then...
---------------------------------------

    1. On Mac, we go into the command palette: cmd+shift+p / and then, "Python: Select Interpreter" / Select the very latest version that we have installed. 
    2. On Windows, we go to the command palette: ctrl+shift+p / and then, same as on Mac 

        Once the interpreter was selected, we can go to the script and right-click, "Run Python File in Terminal"
        Also, we can do "Run Selection/Line in Python Terminal", this will only run the selection/line and will keep Python opened in the Terminal for us to keep on doing things.
