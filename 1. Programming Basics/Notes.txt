When saving the source code, the extensions for each programming language are as follow:
- Python: ".py"
- JavaScript: ".js"
- Perl: ".pl"
- Kotlin: ".kt"



3 ways of turning the code into execution:
- Compile
- Interpret
- Both

        *This means that we will have three separated groups of languages:
            1. Compiled languages: C, C++ and Objective-C 
            2. Interpreted languages: PHP and JavaScript
            3. Combination: Java, C# and Python



IDE: Integrated Development Environments
    - XCode: for iOS applications
    - Visual Studio Code: for the rest. It has "IntelliSense", which is a smart way of referring to the Autocompletion feature. 
    - Android Studio: for... Android
    - RubyMine: Seems to be for Ruby on/and Rails, or just Ruby (not sure if they are the same thing)
