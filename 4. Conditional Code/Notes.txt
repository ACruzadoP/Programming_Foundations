Relational operators. I know them but let's have a quick reminder just because.

    1. ==
    2. !=
    3. <
    4. > 
    5. <=
    6. >=

        *I know what they do and if you don't, Google is your friend buddy! xD




There are some examples of if statements in "Exercise Files\Chap04"
    *IMPORTANT: On Python, indentation is needed. So we use tab or 4 spaces after an if statement, or it will be empty.   



Python
-------
    if plant == "Cacti":
        print(plant, "don't need a lot of water")
    else:
        print(plant, "love water")


Java
------
    if (plant == "Cacti"){
        System.out.println("Plant doesn't need a lot of water");
    }
    else {
        System.out.println("Plant loves water");
    }
        

Ruby
-----
    if 5 > 6
        puts "nope"
    else   
        puts "yes"
    end
